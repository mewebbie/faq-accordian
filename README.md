## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Vannila JS + jQuery.js

### What I learned

I always believe that more of learning happens when one tries to implement already learnt techniques. This is the first time I had attempted to design a responsive webpage and I'm quite happy with the way I gathered concepts and techniques to successfully complete this project.

### Continued development

I really look forward to clear my doubts about keyframes and transitions of CSS as they excite me a lot. I would also like to focus on JS libraries that have become very much popular and every web-developer is expected to have a good idea about them.
